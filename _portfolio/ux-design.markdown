# Routes - Navigation App
Routes is a travel app that will allow users to get to their desired destination while marking additional locations along the way related to their interests. The user simply enters where they want to go, selects what kind of services/businesses they are looking for, and the app generates routes based off the chosen interests. The Routes App was a group collaboration between me and three other designers, and then I modified our original design by applying Google's Material Design system to the layout.
