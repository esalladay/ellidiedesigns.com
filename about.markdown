Hi! I'm Ellidie Salladay and here you will find more information about myself. I am a self motivated nature lover dedicated to my work and am currently seeking real world experience in the design industry, specifically in front-end web development. 
I enjoy taking hikes with my dog and swimming under the sun. When I'm not outside, you may find me immersed in a book or lost in a video game. 

Need to contact me?

You can reach me via my email ellidiesallday@eagles.ewu.edu
