## Project 1

[V For Vendetta Movie Trailer](https://esalladay.github.io/vforvendetta/)

This was my first project working with video and embedding it into the page without using the youtube embedding tool. My goal was to make the design match the movie using JS Lettering. As soon as I found the JS Lettering plugin that creates a domino effect, I knew it would be perfect because V For Vendetta implements the use of dominos as well, and I felt it really tied the site to the movie.
