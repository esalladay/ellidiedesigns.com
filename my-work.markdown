## Project 1

[V For Vendetta Movie Trailer](https://esalladay.github.io/vforvendetta/)

This was my first project working with video and embedding it into the page without using the youtube embedding tool. My goal was to make the design match the movie using JS Lettering. As soon as I found the JS Lettering plugin that creates a domino effect, I knew it would be perfect because V For Vendetta implements the use of dominos as well, and I felt it really tied the site to the movie.

## Project 2

[Steampunk Google Doodle! ](https://esalladay.github.io/google-doodle/)

Google Doodles are always a joy for me to look at, and creating one made me see how challenging and complex they could be. My first doodle attempt was simple, but lacking  the aesthetic of Steampunk I wanted to encapsulate. My goal was to show a Steampunk city in motion and full of life.
